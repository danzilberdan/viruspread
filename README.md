# Viruspread
Improve the accuracy of government policies aimed at slowing the spread of viruses.

## How can we improve government policies?
Policies are represented by the `Mitigation` class. 
In order to optimize the values of the policies we should first simulate a human community in which the virus spreads.
Currently this is done in the `VirusSimulator` class.
The policy's performance is then measured using a fitness function that can take various considerations 
including death count, human happiness and government cost. Finally, the policies should be optimized using a genetic algorithm.

## Can I join the project?
Developers with ranging skills from basic Python programming to Machine Learning and Graph Algorithms are very welcome to join.
